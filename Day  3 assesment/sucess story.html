If you mention a few sentences for how much Dhoni trusts the team, then remember when in the 2007 World T20 final, Mahendra Singh Dhoni got the last over from Joginder Sharma instead of Harbhajan Singh.
Similarly, in the league round of the same World T20 Cup, India’s match against Pakistan was tied and the match was to be decided by ball out. 
Pakistan chose regular bowlers here while Dhoni played part-time bowlers like Virender Sehwag and Robin Uthappa besides Harbhajan Singh and won the match.
Likewise, despite being a specialist batsman, Dhoni used Yuvraj as a regular bowler in the 2011 World Cup and was able to surround the opponents with this bet. With the confidence of Dhoni, Yuvraj took 75 overs in 9 matches and took 15 wickets, then he took two wickets in the quarter-finals, semifinal and final.
Similarly, in the 2011 World Cup, Dhoni kept Suresh Raina and R Ashwin hidden in the opening matches and used them as a ‘surprise package’ in the knockout round which benefited Team India in the quarter-finals against Australia and the semi-final against Pakistan.
Dhoni’s story of trusting his team is endless and he, like the ‘Milestone’, continued to exert his energy to refine the young players! Dhoni also showed confidence in the players who were not successful or were not successful immediately.
For example, fast bowler Ashish Nehra did not prove to be effective in the opening matches of the 2011 World Cup, but Dhoni gave him a chance in the semi-final match against Pakistan. Nehra also proved to be successful against Australia.
